1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

11/10
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
- 4/4 Identifying the most popular activities
- 3/3 Adding a text search interface

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

It took me around 10 hours to complete this assignment.

3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)

I only used ChatGPT to help with completing this assignment. 

The queries I used were simple queries that I could've used Google for but would've taken longer to sift through. 
A few examples:
- Does static exist in typescript?
- How can I load a file in typescript?
- How can I get the day of week from a date object?
etc...

Additionally, for the bonus points, I did have to take two files, one tracking the positive words, and the other tracking negative words.

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I did not consult any classmates or other individuals.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
There is nothing special. However, like I mentioned above, I did need to downlaod the negative-words.txt and positive-words.txt for the sentiment analysis.
